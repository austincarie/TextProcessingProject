This program uses the Stanford NLP library to tag each word in a given document with its part of speech. We
have if statements that check for nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. and adds to their respective totals. At the end
the program displays totals for sentences, words, and parts of speech. The only missing component of our program is
a way for it to count the number of paragraphs in the document. The program reads from an external text file and
tags each word sentence by sentence.
